<h1>Digital Electronics: Quick Chapter Summary</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: What is a Computer? (Hardware vs Software)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Defines a computer as a device that takes input, processes data, stores information, and produces output (IPSO model).</li>
  <li>Distinguishes hardware as physical components, software as the instructions that run on the hardware, and firmware as the bridge between them.</li>
  <li>Shows how layers (user, software, OS, drivers, hardware) interact in real scenarios like typing and saving documents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 2: Motherboards: Evolution & Functions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The motherboard is the main circuit board connecting all internal parts and ensuring communication between CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals.</li>
  <li>Discusses motherboard sizes, chipsets, expansion slots, connectivity, and BIOS/UEFI chips.</li>
  <li>Explains differences between desktop/mainboard and smartphone (system-on-a-chip) approaches, plus key points for choosing a motherboard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 3: Chipsets, BIOS/UEFI & The Boot Process</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chipsets manage data between CPU, memory, storage, and I/O ports; modern designs merge Northbridge functions into the CPU.</li>
  <li>Explains the step-by-step boot process: power-up, POST (hardware checks), finding the boot device, loading bootloader, then loading the OS.</li>
  <li>Compares BIOS and UEFI (interface, speed, drive size limits, security). BIOS stores settings in CMOS RAM powered by the motherboard battery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 4: CPU—From Logical Architecture to Silicon</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, executing billions of instructions per second.</li>
  <li>Describes core components: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), registers (fast internal memory for operations).</li>
  <li>Covers instruction cycles (fetch, decode, execute, store), clock speed, CPI (cycles per instruction), and performance optimization methods like pipelining and caching.</li>
  <li>Outlines CPU development from logical design to physical silicon, including wafer production and packaging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 5: Memory—RAM, ROM, Cache, Storage Hierarchy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Memory types: RAM (fast, volatile), ROM (non-volatile, startup code), cache (very fast, inside CPU), SSD/HDD (permanent, large, slowest).</li>
  <li>Explains memory hierarchy (registers, cache, RAM, storage) as the balance between speed and cost.</li>
  <li>Discusses practical aspects: choosing RAM and SSD, advantages of SSD over HDD, memory in smartphones, and flash memory cell types (SLC, MLC, TLC, QLC).</li>
</ul>
